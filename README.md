# Horiseon-Refractor

This is the refraction of the Horiseon Social Solution Services Website.

## Description
<p>This iteration of webpage for Horiseon Social Solution Servives was, first and foremost, reworked to include accessability attributes. In addition, this new version is cleaned up and published with updated HTML semanics.</p>

## Usage
The purpose of adding accessability attributes to the Horiseon webpage was to allow individuals with lost of sight and other disabilies to be able to understand not only the textual aspects of the page, but the imagry as well. Without textural descriptors, screen readers would only read image file names without providing detail on the image content.

Additionally, the website had improper HTML semantics. This new version has a smoothed workflow and commented code to allow further work to be done on the page with ease. These changes **did not** change the overall look of the seen webpage by the user, but rather created a more readable code to the developer.
